# Tabletop

A new, intelligent workspace for the web. Created by [Unternet](https://unternet.co).

## Releasing

From the latest version of main, run `npm run release`. This will select a version bump based on semantic commits, create a release branch, edit the changelog, and push. (You may want to optionally edit the changelog for clarity).

Publish this branch, and merge with main. This will trigger the build & publish to NPM.
